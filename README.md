# LPC1114-Temp-EmbeddedSystem

Description:
 The objective of this project is to take the temperature of a control unit and wirelessly transmit the temperature a 
 GUI computer host using LPC1114 chip, keypad, LCD, UART using Bluetooth, C and C# GUI and LM35.
 
  The system is able to collect the current temperature of a place using the LM35 temperature sensor, then transmit that analog value through ADC (Analog digital converter) to the chip, and display that value on the LCD screen and at the same time on the GUI(Graphic User interface).
  
  

Software Used:
 IDE: Keil, Visual studio code(For the C# GUI)
 CodeBase: C/C++ and C#
